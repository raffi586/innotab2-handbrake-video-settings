Settings for Handbrake to create videos suitable for playback on the VTect InnoTab 2

Importing Settings Into Handbrake
---------------------------------

To import these settings into Handbrake save the file Innotab2.plist to your local machine. Launch Handbrake, and select Import from the Presets menu. Point this at the Innotab2.plist file. You should now have InnoTab2 Video available in your Preset Draw.

Converting A Video
------------------

To convert a video load it into Handbrake by clicking the Source icon and selecting your video. Click InnoTab 2 Video from your Preset Draw. Now change the destination to whereever you want to save it, but change the extension from .mp4 to .avi . Now Add to Queue and Start. The video will now convert.

Saving A Video To The InnoTab 2
-------------------------------

To save your converted video to the InnoTab 2 connect it to your computer. Open up one of the drives it maps to your computer, and go into LLN, then VIDEOS and save your video there. Safely disconnect the InnoTab 2, and when you next look at the Videos on your InnoTab 2 your new video should be there.
